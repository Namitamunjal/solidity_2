# Solidity_2
In this repository , we will learn about exception handling in SOLIDITY.

# Overview
For this repository, we will make a smart contract that implements the require(), assert() and revert() statements which are error handling statements in Solidity.


# Contract Details
Contract name: test

# Functions
We have used different functions to check different error handling methods in solidity.
one:
In this we have used require() function. It is used to validate certain conditions before further execution of the function. 

two:
In this we have used assert() function. It checks for a condition, if the condition fails, function execution terminates with an error message.

three:
In this we have used revert() function . It can be used to flag an error and revert the current call.

# Deployment and Usage
Contracts in solidity can be deployed in following ways:

Compile the smart contract (you can set it to auto compile) in any Solidity Compiler like here we have used remix.
2.Deploy the contract on Ethereum Network.

# Deployment Environment
This contract can be deployed in any version of solidity between 0.7.0 to 0.9.0.
